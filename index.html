        <h2>Ever thought about...</h2>
        <p class="text-next-to-calendar">
            ...that something strange is happening on a certain day  during the week? Did you feel sometimes like, "Is this a Déjá-vu?"? 
            If so, than you´re at the right place to search for answers! We do feel the same and it remains repeating continously. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-next-to-calendar">
            But why is it happening, and how to stop it?
        </p>
        <p class="text-next-to-calendar">
            You may ask yourself: "what the ... are they talking about?"
            That´s exactly the point for your which makes it so interesting to find it out...
        </p>
        <p class="text-next-to-calendar">
            You´re getting more and more curious what´s behind the curtain? Than you have the right mindset.
            Lay back and think about your present year. How was it so far? Did anything special happened to you? No? Are you sure?
            No you´re not! And that´s the point. Every week is something strange going on and it feels weird but somehow you start to 
            recognize what I´m talking about.

        Now let´s dig a bit deeper:
        Assume that a specific "universal" power would lighten your mind and open the whole view to your environment.
        There is a lot of stuff which passes and you never recognized it.
        Last week, last month, today... just start thinking about what happened and you can´t explain it. 
        It´s like the Bermuda triangle of minds. Does it make sense to you?

        Awesome! You see how easy it is to progress?
        Yet we become clear, that there is a specific process going on, which seems to put all this beatiful and lovely things
        which happens to you during a central part of the week into a common sense. 
        As important it is to understand how it works, the more important it becomes to understand why.
        Here we will start to research some of the main aspects which are linked to "The Day".<br>

        We´ve put a lot of work into investigation and analysis of the omnipresent phenomenom. The first time it became obvious to us
        was, when we started to realize the strange and unknown vibes which we could indetify into a weekly pattern.<br>
        Than it began, we focused on an unusual way to tiny little subelements during a normal day and compared them to the specials of a weekly experience.<br>
        If you re-think and try to remember all the past weeks, months and years, than it will blew up your mind!

        It´s like somebody hold and shake your sholders to say: Hey, wake up!!!<br>
        And that´s exactly how we´ve experienced it the first time. The old phrase "I was blind, but now I can see" get´s a total different meaning. 
        Why people continously win the lottery on a specific day? How is it possible that you feel special on a certain day?<br>
        You may now think that´s only coincidence but it´s not. The thruth is, it happens every "The Day"!<br>
        Here it comes again: "The Day"<br>
        What is it? Why it does not have a normal naming like e.g. Monday, Tuesday or Friday? The answer is pretty complex and cannot be given in only a few sentences.
