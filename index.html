        <h2>Ever thought about...</h2>
        <p>
            ...that something strange is happening on a certain day  during the week? Did you feel sometimes like, "Is this a Déjá-vu?"? 
            If so, than you´re at the right place to search for answers! We do feel the same and it remains repeating continously. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But why is it happening, and how to stop it?
        </p>
        <p>
            You may ask yourself: "what the ... are they talking about?"
            That´s exactly the point for your which makes it so interesting to find it out...
        </p>
        <p>
            You´re getting more and more curious what´s behind the curtain? Than you have the right mindset.
            Lay back and think about your present year. How was it so far? Did anything special happened to you? No? Are you sure?
            No you´re not! And that´s the point. Every week is something strange going on and it feels weird but somehow you start to 
            recognize what I´m talking about.
